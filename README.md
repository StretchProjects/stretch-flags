## Playing With stretch-flags

If you wish to work on stretch-flags in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

Once running, you can preview your element at
